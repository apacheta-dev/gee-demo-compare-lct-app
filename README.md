# Land Cover Maps Comparison Tool - DEMO for Haiti

This repository contains the source code for a **Google Earth Engine (GEE) App** designed to **analyze land degradation due to land cover change**, supporting the computation of **SDG indicator 15.3.1** (Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area).

The app focuses on the **land cover sub-indicator** of SDG 15.3.1 and supports analysis workflows aligned with **UNCCD reporting through the PRAIS platform**.

## 🔗 Live Demo

A deployed example of the application is available here:

👉 https://apacheta.projects.earthengine.app/view/compare-lct-hti

The demo illustrates land degradation analysis based on land cover change for the computation of **SDG indicator 15.3.1**.

## 📌 About

This project provides a **Google Earth Engine application** to analyze **land degradation caused by land cover change**, enabling the comparison of land cover maps, visualization of transitions, and calculation of land cover statistics required to compute **SDG indicator 15.3.1**.

The app is aligned with the **UNCCD Good Practice Guidance** and supports workflows used in the **PRAIS reporting platform**, where degradation due to land cover change is one of the three core sub-indicators of SDG 15.3.1.

The repository includes:
- A modular GEE application for interactive analysis.
- Scripts to compute land cover indicators from globally available land cover products, including **ESA CCI Land Cover** (Default product for Land Cover analysis in PRAIS).

## 📁 App Folder: `app-lct`

The `app-lct` folder contains **all scripts required for the GEE application to function**.  
The app is responsible for visualization, interaction, and summarization of **land cover degradation results**.

### `app.js`
- Main entry point of the application.
- Initializes map panels, UI layout, and interactions.
- Connects land cover products, transitions, and statistics.
- This is the script executed in the GEE Code Editor to run the app or to publish it.

### `legends.js`
- Defines reusable functions to build legends and layer controls.

### `localization.js`
- Stores all user interface labels.
- Supports multiple languages.
- Facilitates adaptation to national reporting contexts without modifying the app logic.

### `precalculation.js`
- Defines the **land cover sub-indicator configuration for SDG 15.3.1**.
- Specifies:
  - Land cover products
  - Reporting periods
  - Class mappings (e.g. IPCC classes)
- Controls how statistics are computed.

### `precalculation_sample.js`
- Intended as a starting point for adapting the app to new countries and run all the statistics .

## 📁 Land Cover Reclassification and Transitions folder

The `LC-Reclass-Transitions` folder contains scripts required to **compute land cover indicators and transitions** used by the app.

These scripts:
- Reclassify land cover maps into the **seven UNCCD land cover classes**.
- Compute land cover change and transition matrices.
- Generate land cover degradation layers.

The workflow supports **three globally available land cover products**, including:

- **ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Land Cover**  
  → *Used by default in the PRAIS platform for UNCCD reporting*
- GLAD Land Cover
- GLC Land Cover

Outputs generated by these scripts are expected to be exported as **Earth Engine assets**, which are then consumed by the GEE App.

## 🌍 How to Adapt This App for a New Country

1. Open the **Google Earth Engine Code Editor**:  
   https://code.earthengine.google.com
2. Copy the contents of the `app-lct` folder into your GEE repository and update script file paths accordingly.
3. Update country-specific terminology and labels in `localization.js`.
4. Create the land cover assets required by the app by running the scripts located in the `LC-Reclass-Transitions` folder.
5. Adapt `precalculation.js` to select land cover products and reporting periods processed in step 4.
6. Replace the FeatureCollections in `precalculation_sample.js`, run the script, and export the resulting FeatureCollections.
7. Update the precalculated collections referenced in `app.js`, then run the script to launch the app and explore maps and statistics.
8. Publish the app (optional).
